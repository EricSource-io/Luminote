# Welcome to Luminote!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Luminote, a versatile note-taking project that's a work in progress. 
I'm tinkering with it solo, so bear with me.

## Tech Stack:
- **Electron.js**: Using Electron because it lets me throw together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
make this thing run on Windows, maxOS, and Linux.

- **Node.js**: Handling the behind-the-scenes stuff, Node.js gives me access to the file system
and other nifty system resources using JavaScript.

- **React.js**: The UI is built with React because it makes life easier.

- **Redux**: Manages application state efficiently, offering a centralized store
for streamlined data flow and state updates. 

## Current State
Check out this preview of what Luminote looks like now:

It's not super fancy yet, but we'll get there.

## Installation
Hang tight! Luminote, my solo dev adventure, is not ready to mingle with your desktop yet. 

## Platform support
Luminote's aiming to be versatile. Whether you're on a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine,
I'm working to make sure it runs smoothly.
